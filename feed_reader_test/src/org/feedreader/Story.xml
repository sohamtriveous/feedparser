Or better, when did your mom last shout at you for not accompanying her to the temple for a <em>puja</em>! Well, we just discovered something that you will love if you hate going to temples. Just go to Saranam.com, chose the temple of your choice and order a <em>puja </em>online. Yes, it’s that simple. In a few hundred rupees, you would be able to get a <em>puja</em> done at the temple of your choice. Saranam will send its representatives to perform the <em>puja</em> on your behalf and send you the offerings (only the non-perishable ones).</p><p>Anisha Mehta from YourStory.in speaks to Mahesh Mohanan, founder of Saranam.com to understand his business better.</p><p><strong>Hi Mahesh, tell us about yourself and how you started your dotcom venture.</strong></p><p>After graduating as a mechanical engineer, I worked for a company which was manufacturing adapters and chargers. Later, I moved into sales in a chemical company before starting up a software development venture with a schoolmate.</p><p>The idea to start a service to facilitate rituals at temples was born when I undertook a pilgrimage. Those days, I was involved in developing e-commerce websites for my clients. Once I got back from the pilgrimage, I felt that there is a huge market for providing spiritual services. And the response we received was positive. We were surprised when we had about 50 requests in the very first month after the launch and we were wondering how to take it further. This was whenN Kumarof the Sanmar Group expressed interest in investing in this venture. Once we were funded by him, we were able to afford a team to travel and set up a network to service various temples acrossIndiaand also enhance the website. We had invested roughly Rs 16 lakhs when we launched the service.</p><p><strong>So what all services does Saranam offer and who are you target customers?</strong></p><p>Our services range from facilitating worship in temples across India, performing <em>homams </em>(fire rituals) on behalf of our customers to astrology services and spiritual products such as lamps, deity idols and <em>rudraksha </em>beads. Our aim is to make Saranam the most comprehensive and unbiased source of information related to Hinduism, to create awareness and dispel myths about Hinduism. People who want access to rituals at temples are our target audience. Although we know that our business can cater to only a select number of people, I believe that we still can sustain our business with this limitation.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>What’s the traction and customer feedback been like since you started?</strong></p><p>We receive about 200 to 300 requests per month. Over time, our customer base has increased and now we have about 8000 regular (who order at least once a year) customers in total. Most of our services and products are designed and created according to customer needs. For instance, when many of our customers wrote and told us that they would like to participate in <em>homams </em>but could not afford them frequently, we introduced the concept of group <em>homams</em>.</p><p><strong>How do your operations work? Which logistics provider do you work with?</strong></p><p>For conducting <em>pujas </em>in temples, we have a network of representatives around the country who travel to the temple and have the <em>puja </em>performed at the temple, pay the fee and purchase the materials required for the <em>puja </em>on behalf of our client.  Once we receive an order, we forward the details to our representative. Once the <em>puja </em>is performed, he sends us the offerings through courier and we in turn pack and ship it to the devotee who has requested the <em>puja</em>. We also offer homam services using our team of well-trained priests. For both <em>pujas </em>and <em>homams</em>, we send only non-perishable items to the customer. Perishable offerings like fruits are distributed to the poor at the temple. We use FedEx for overseas shipments and DTDC for local shipments. We also use India Post for free shipments abroad.</p><p>For our astrology services, we have a team of astrologers who analyze horoscopes and prepare reports with predictions and remedies that are sent to our customers who order them. The reports are sent through email.</p><p><strong>How big is your team and what are you current challenges?</strong></p><p>We run operations with a team of three at our Chennai office. We have outsourced development and our franchisee network works on per order basis. We have a team of 10 priests also works while our astrology team comprises of five people.</p><p>In terms of challenges, initially we found it hard to build trust with our customers. We are involved in providing services that are carried out remotely and where nothing tangible is sent back to the customer. Also, sourcing funds and hiring the right people are the challenges we face.</p><p><strong>What are your expansion plans?</strong></p><p>We yearn to increase our temple network. We have recently launched pranic healing services and a new version of our website. We now plan to add more content on Hinduism and introduce more spiritual services.</p><p>Go to <a

href="http://webengage.com/">http://webengage.com</a>), has raised its first round of funding from Indian Angel Network. The funds will be utilized in expanding product offering, creating technology differentiators, marketing and human capital.</p><p>Launched in May, 2011, WebEngage has two core products focused on customer engagement – feedback and contextual surveys. While existing engagement tools like UserVoice and GetSatisfaction gather feedback, WebEngage goes deeper allowing publishers to create surveys that can be targeted at visitors on their website based on behaviour, geography and profile to seamlessly gather proactive feedback to improve their product offering and drive conversions.</p><p>WebEngage was founded by ex-engineering team members at burrp.com – the local lifestyle portal that was acquired by Infomedia18 in 2009. Speaking on the first round of funding from IAN, <strong>Avlesh Singh, co-founder &amp; CEO, WebEngage</strong> said, “<em>From concept to execution, we knew that WebEngage will usher in a new era in customer engagement on the web. We have already come out of private beta and closed deals with 400 web businesses including Cleartrip, Future Group, One97 and Just-Eat Global. This shows the faith that consumer centric companies have in WebEngage product and how we can create positive impact on their online businesses.”</em><em> </em></p><p><em>” It is a privilege to have industry stalwarts as our investors and we are confident that the investment will help us accelerate growth and expand in markets outside India. We have added IAN member and lead investor Rajan Anandan to the company’s board”</em>, Avlesh added.</p><p>The first round of funding has been raised from the Indian AngelNetwork,India’s largest organized angel network. The investors in WebEngage include active angel investors Rajan Anandan, Sunil Kalra, Sadeesh Raghavan, Ashim Mehra, Nitin Singhal, Pradeep Gupta and Harish Mehta.</p><p><strong>Rajan Anandan</strong>, an active investor in early stage technology companies, who led the investment from the network said, “<em>The worldwide web has now crossed two billion users and there are millions of web based businesses across the world. Deeply engaging with users is one of the most important priorities for such businesses and WebEngage provides simple, yet powerful SaaS based solutions to help businesses achieve customer satisfaction, marketing and sales objectives. We are confident that WebEngage will set new standards in customer engagement, and real time customer feedback.</em>”</p><p>Indian Angel Network, early investors in WebEngage, is the first and largest pan-India Angel network comprising several ofIndia’s successful entrepreneurs and CEOs who share a passion for early stage businesses. The Network has over 170 members and has made more than 25 investments across multiple sectors like IT,Mobileand Education and has made several successful exits.</p> <br/><p><h4>You may also like to read:</h4></p><ol><li><a

In a market where EV companies need a lucrative space to showcase their products, Evhub.in steps in as an online B2B platform catering to such businesses. In a conversation with Anisha Mehta from YourStory.in, co-founders Murali Krishna and Sireesha Murali share more.</p><p><strong>Tell us something about EVHUB</strong></p><p>EVHUB is an online B2B platform for electric vehicles where EV companies and automobile spare parts suppliers meet and do business. The electric vehicles business is still in a nascent stage but is a growing trend. Suppliers and OEMs can join EVHUB and add their company profiles and products for free for getting maximum exposure online and reach their target audience. EVHUB also offers advertising services for companies, organises events, and offers products and help in branding, getting sales leads and reaching out a specific audience. EVHUB also sells electric bike spare parts online. The company has tons of free information on electric vehicles inIndiain form of articles, product comparisons, discussion forums, updated news, product reviews on EVs and green technologies around the world.</p><p><strong>How did you come up with the idea?</strong></p><p>Electric vehicles have always been my passion and web-designing is my hobby. The idea to create a portal for electric vehicles came with the vision to promote electric vehicles through the internet. EVHUB was first launched in 2008 as an experiment or hobby rather to only share our experiences on EVs and putting up news and informative articles on the electric vehicle industry. But soon we realised that there is a market for such vehicles and finally in 2011, we started EVHUB as an online media site to promote green technologies exclusively for the Indian market. .</p><p><strong>Murali and Sireesha, if you can tell us something about your prior work experience?</strong></p><p>After completing my masters degree in electrical engineering fromJadavpurUniversity, I have been working in the electric vehicles industry. I am a motor designer by profession and was introduced to electric vehicles while working with Samhyun Co Ltd inSouth Korea. I have had the opportunity to work with a number of electric vehicle technology startups, leading the team and building the company divisions from scratch. These opportunities and experience have taught me to be an entrepreneur. Sireesha has done her masters degree in organic chemistry and also is a MBA graduate. Earlier, she was into business development in e-learning companies but is now working full time with EVHUB.</p><p><strong><a

class="alignright size-full wp-image-9545" src="http://yourstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/evhub1.jpg" alt="EVHUB" width="300" height="599" /></a>How much capital did you invest in your venture?</strong></p><p>Till now, I have invested around Rs 3,00,000 from my personal savings on web-design, server maintenance of various websites relating to EVHUB, advertising and promotional activities.<br
/> <strong>Who are your customers?</strong></p><p>Chennai-based BSA Motors and Coimbatore-based Eco-dynamic equipments are our customers. The site has helped them reach out a large number of customers. We are also expecting many other OEMs and spare part manufacturers to join our customer base soon. Also, electric bikes OEMs, dealers and end users are our customers in our online e-bike spare sales. EVHUB is the agent for various international events (currently dealing with AAITF, China and Auto Expo Kenya) for selling their exhibition space to Indian auto companies.</p><p><strong>What are the challenges of setting up a venture like this especially when the EV vehicles market is still at a nascent stage?</strong></p><p>The main challenge we are facing is lack of financial support for the venture, so I had to use my personal savings as and when required. But the passion towards promoting EVs is the secret of its survival. When we started EVHUB, the electric vehicles market was in an infant stage in India. Hence, a lot of hard work has gone into getting people’s attention and creating awareness on what exactly are electric vehicles.</p><p><strong>What is your traction rate and how much has translated into sales?</strong></p><p>We currently have slightly more than 30,000 unique visitors per month with maximum viewership in India, US and China. The sales conversion rate was low when we launched the site but recently we have notice that online e-bike spares sale is growing steadily and we are recording an increase in revenues. We are also interested in expanding to USA and China.</p><p><strong>Define your revenue model.</strong></p><p>EVHUB gets its revenue from its virtual showrooms, sales leads generated from event management and technology companies, online EV spares sales, advertising space and premium memberships to companies for promoting their products. Our interest is to give an online identity to small and medium sized companies and hence our pricing is low to suit their budgets.</p><p><strong>How big is your team? Are you looking at hiring?</strong></p><p>We started with one and we are now a six-member team. As our activities are growing day by day, we need to hire people. We require a full time web designer and marketing team. We are looking for funding before we start expanding the team.</p><p><strong>There are similar companies in India like Evfuture.com. What kind of challenges does that pose to EVHUB?</strong></p><p>Yes, now-a-days there are many similar websites coming online. This is a good sign as it indicates that the market for such products is growing. I think for next three years we are not thinking of competing with similar players as our sole objective is to promote the use of electric vehicles.</p><p><strong>What is your market differentiator?</strong></p><p>Our market differentiator is our exhaustive understanding of electric vehicle technology, market scenario, efficient media campaigns, global contacts in EV technical and media, a strong supply chain for our e-commerce activities and our wide reach to end users.</p><p>Do check out <a

It means learning by doing and very well complements the traditional classroom teaching. It is actively being used in universities in developed countries. However in India, there is a long way to go to adopt experiential learning in university curriculum”, says Paraj Shrivastava, founder of SidApps Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</p><p>Experiential learning benefits the students who after finishing their studies join companies with basic understanding of the functioning of an enterprise in an integrated manner. It is one of the steps to bridge the gap which exists between campus and corporate. As an embodiment of this technique, SidApps has come up with a simulation game called ELiSA.</p><p>Jubin Mehta from YourStory caught up with entrepreneur Paraj to know more about this. Excerpts:</p><p><strong>Learning through interaction is definitely the best way. What was the spark to make this game?</strong></p><p>While I was doing my part time Executive General Management program at IIM Bangalore in 2009, I was introduced to one business simulation game, which is an experiential learning tool but it was more of a business strategy game and had its limitations to cover business processes.</p><p>I thought of plugging that gap, so as to give an end to end perspective on the functioning of an enterprise, focusing on integrated business processes. Thus ELiSA (Enterprise Learning in Simulated Arena) was born. ELiSA is an attempt to demonstrate in a package, the learning which addresses the industry expectations from their employees to deliver superior organizational business performance. ELiSA is the catalyst to achieve these objectives.</p><p><strong>Tell us a bit about your background.</strong></p><p>I graduated in 1997 with a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from REC (now NIT) Jaipur and completed my Executive General Management Program from IIM Bangalore in 2009. I have 12 years of SAP domain expertise and an all-round experience of 14 years with a proven track record in consulting, product development, operations, project and people management.</p><p><strong>What technology has gone into the making of the simulation?</strong></p><p>One of the objectives for ELiSA game is to make it affordable for everybody. Keeping this objective in mind, we decided to use open source technologies like PHP and MySQL. The other organizational objective is to have a very minimal capital expenditure, which is very important for a start-up and so ELiSA game is hosted in a cloud environment.</p><p><strong>How long did it take to roll out the final product?</strong></p><p>It took one year to roll out the beta version of ELiSA game.</p><p><strong>What kind of research went on to develop the content?</strong></p><p>It required research in multiple disciplines in management such as strategy, planning, purchasing, production, marketing and finance. Lot of effort has gone in to study various simulation techniques to simulate the market environment and implement the one which best suits the requirement for ELiSA game. The third part of the research was to study the ERP modelling to develop our own simulator. The biggest challenge was to put together and integrate the inputs from subject matter experts in various areas which are very diverse in ELiSA game. We also brainstormed on the depth of content for the ELiSA game to keep it optimal for the suggested duration to play the simulation game.</p><p><strong>When was the product launched and who are the end-users currently?</strong></p><p>The product was launched in July 2011 and it is being used mostly by MBA and ERP institutes in B2B segment. We are awaiting approval from an Indian payment gateway and very soon it will be open to online purchasing by any individual in B2C segment, who would like to learn the basic concepts of business process integration.</p><p><strong>The demo looks interesting. How long would an average simulation with thorough participation take?</strong></p><p>There are two variants of the game. First variant needs to have a minimum of four human teams playing against each other in one simulated market. The second variant is for an individual who plays against three other computer virtual teams. Both variants are available in either two or four rounds, each round representing one financial year. It takes on an average four hours to complete the two rounds game and six hours for four rounds of game, which includes the preparation time.</p><p>Participants can anytime pause and logout from the system. They can resume later to continue.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to promote the product?</strong></p><p>In the B2B segment, we are currently in discussions with some large training organizations for strategic partnerships to offer ELiSA game in B-schools at pan India level. We are also in the process of having tie-ups with training providers to offer the ELiSA game to corporates. In B2C segment, the plan is to promote it online. We will soon come up with a reseller program to have ERP training institutes acting as reseller to offer ELiSA game to their enrolled students.</p><p><strong>Tell us a bit about your clients.</strong></p><p>At the moment, for the beta release of ELiSA game, my clients are mostly individual students and few MBA colleges in Bangalore. The plan is to increase the number of distribution points and have more channels to cover different segments.</p><p><strong>Would the repetition of the simulation throw up different learnings if the same employee or student plays again?</strong></p><p>The result of each simulation varies depending on the inputs by each team. The virtual team’s inputs are also not constant. However the learning is similar if the participant plays again. ELiSA game has 80 percent serious learning embedded in it, which is system driven and the rest is the gaming quotient.</p><p><strong>What is your revenue model?</strong></p><p>We are following the differentiation strategy and ELiSA game is offered on SaaS “Software as a Service” model. It is cloud hosted and available anytime, on demand and pay per use basis. It would be sold directly by SidApps over the internet to individual B2C customers.  It would be sold to B2B segment (mostly MBA colleges and ERP institutes), largely through marketing partnerships and resellers.</p><p><strong>Are more games in different fields in the pipeline at SidApps?</strong></p><p>We plan to develop simulations specific to Finance, Marketing, Operations and Human Resources for which research work has started and hopefully we bring them in the next 18 months.</p><p>We are also interested in developing a project management simulation game, though we haven’t done any market survey in India, but in my opinion there is a need for it.</p> <br/><p><h4>You may also like to read:</h4></p><ol><li><a

The demutualised Exchange set up by Financial Technologies (India) Ltd. (FTIL) has permanent recognition from the Government of India in order to facilitate online trading and for clearance and settlement operations for commodity futures across the country.</p><p>Sarita Bahl, Vice President,<strong> </strong>MCX, tells YourStory the story on how they came about to<strong> </strong>create these rural service centres, thereby transforming them from mere producers to marketers and aimed at ensuring that the benefits of commodity exchanges reach the recesses of rural India.</p><p><strong>What is the Gramin Suvidha Kendra by MCX all about?</strong></p><p>Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited (MCX)<a

It has a market share of around 80 percent of the Indian commodity futures market and 2000 registered members.</p><p>MCX was ranked as the world’s sixth largest commodity exchange in the year 2010. The exchange envisions a unified Indian commodity market driven by market forces and a level playing field for all stakeholders. It aims at bringing together farmers, consumers, traders, exporters, importers on a single platform.</p><p>In June 2006, MCX and India Post formed a strategic alliance to create rural service centres, ‘Gramin Suvidha Kendra’ (GSK) aimed at ensuring that the benefits of commodity exchanges reach the recesses of rural India, through a single-window service for farmers’ pre and post harvest requirements.</p><p>GSK is a unique marketing Public Private Partnership (PPP) model based on trust and credibility, and brings transparent markets to farmers’ doorsteps.</p><p>By providing price information, GSK benefits farmers by helping them decide what to sow and when to sell.  GSK also provides services such as addressing technical queries, scientific warehousing facilities, quality agricultural or non-agricultural inputs and bank loans. MCX has entered into partnerships to bring these services under a single hybrid window making the model revenue generative and sustainable.</p><p><strong>How did you come up with the idea?</strong></p><p>Markets in much of India do not function well for those who are most in need of them – reliable market information is hard to find for many farmers, critical inputs are scarce and expensive in times of need and even if available, often of doubtful quality, many service providers tend to be absent from the villages and so on.</p><p>By leveraging its core domain knowledge on how to create efficient market places using modern technology, MCX endeavours to bring markets to the masses, working with an institute – India Post – that is not only widely present in rural areas but is also highly regarded by most rural dwellers.  The ultimate aim is to create a sustainable and comprehensive process of rural development.</p><p><strong>How was the support from employees for this CSR initiative?</strong></p><p>At MCX, CSR activities are viewed as ‘opportunities’ and thus called Corporate Social Opportunities (CSO). The potential opportunities that arise from these CSO activities improve the welfare of the economically marginalized, while simultaneously guaranteeing long term project sustainability and adding value to MCX’s business interests. Employee engagement and buy in are part and parcel of our CSO work.</p><p><strong>What was the outreach of the project?</strong></p><p>As of April 2011, the “Gramin Suvidha Kendra” operates through 26 centres spread across 6 states, reached out to many farmers through over 400 branch post offices of India Post.</p><p><strong><a

class="alignright size-full wp-image-9525" src="http://yourstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mcx.jpg" alt="MCX" width="200" height="77" /></a>What is your background?</strong></p><p>With a masters in Medical and Psychiatric Social Work from Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai coupled with management and science degrees I, Sarita Bahl, bring in 24 years of work experience. My forte lies in my ability to function across different sectors and in various fields like Inclusive Business, Communications and Training.</p><p><strong>What are the challenges in terms of CSR initiative?</strong></p><p>The GSK model was launched with the primary objective of providing price information using postal network and with an idea to provide access to markets for the farmers in future as it becomes feasible. It was a challenge to broaden its scope and area of functioning to help scale up the model.</p><p>Moving away from gratis price information model to putting in place services that would make the model sustainable called for intense rounds of discussions with partners and farmers. Each service had to be rolled out in line with the regulatory framework of the exchange and ensuring that the exchange never steps out of line from its core business.  Managing diverse partners and to mould the model to fit in with their objectives to benefit farmers is one of the biggest challenge in such a project. Hence constant dialogue and intense interactions are required to strike the right balance between all partners.</p><p><strong>How did NSIH benefit you? Please share your experiences with us.</strong></p><p>Being one of the winners of the NSIH-2010 is a source of continuous motivation and inspiration to us. The fact that NSIH award winners go through a rigorous procedure of selection and short listing made us also critically evaluate the model and study it in more depth. Awards like these also help raise our own standards vis-à-vis performance and ensuring that we continue to create that much needed difference that adds value to overall development of the country.</p><p><strong>For more information, please check out </strong><a

href="http://Ayojak.com" target="_blank">Ayojak.com</a> today announced the launch of its integrated Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) solution for event ticket sales across India. Started in 2009, Ayojak.com is a 360 degree event solutions &amp; services platform for online event ticket selling, conference registrations, payment processing, event promotion, and event logistics.</p><p>Santosh Panda, Founder &amp; CEO &#8211; Ayojak.com in conversation with YourStory.in shares – “We see that close to 45-55% of our users have trouble in booking tickets online through Net banking, Credit cards or Debit cards, sometimes the payment gateway is too busy to respond or the connection is very slow and the browser times out. Because of these various reasons most of the users or frustrated with the online ticket booking experience and prefer the offline mode. Even from our in-house research and analysis and from consumer surveys &#8211; we see that the demand for CoD is very high in India,  as a major chunk of our population still do not have access to Debit or Credit cards and not to forget the large community of students as well.”</p><p>Ayojak have integrated their event ticketing &amp; registration e-commerce engine with several logistics solution provider like &#8211; FedEx (AFL), GharPay, and Santa Claus Couriers. This tie up will enable Event Organisers to reach the last miles of customer&#8217;s convenience and enables users to buy event tickets from the comforts of their home, office or other various locations from across 3000 cities/town in India. For all CoD delivered using Ayojak&#8217;s integrated solution, event organizers will be provided with a detailed CoD tracking system and easy, timely and assured delivery of orders. Ayojak has already been privately serving few selected customers to deliver thousands of CoD across India.</p><p>“While CoD has advantages in terms of consumer reach and convenience, it also has its own set of challenges as well – from implementing backend technology for ticket tracking and logistics management to delivering the ticket to consumer at his/her doorstep. And we’ll have to deal with rogue buyers as well” – said Santosh.</p><p>With the booming e-commerce market in India, I think it&#8217;s high time we see few start-ups in the payment gateway solution space who can provide innovative and reliable services.</p><p>YourStory.in wishes Santosh and Ayojak team all the best with their CoD feature launch.

Windows Phone is a huge step up from the previous versions of the Windows Mobile platform and with the number of Windows phones expected to launch in the next few months, we foresee this marketplace to be a great place to monetize our apps.&#8221;</p><p>Focusing on the talent pool among Developers, <strong>‘I unlock Joy’</strong> will encourage participants to build and submit one or more applications on AppHub. Once- certified and published on Windows Phone Marketplace during the program period, they can claim goodies like a brand new Windows Phone, T-Shirts and certificates of acknowledgement from Microsoft India.</p><p>Bonafide participants for the Program are those whose applications have passed certification testing before being published to Windows Phone Marketplace.

We believe that opening up this marketplace will provide the developer community in India with an opportunity to showcase creativity. He added, “The best part about Windows Phone Marketplace is that developers will be able to use familiar development tools and technologies. They create global market opportunities for themselves and reach out to a large user base.”</p><p><strong>Nimish Dubey, a well-known Technology Evangelist,</strong> adds: &#8220;When the Marketplace opened I had predicted the large-scale opportunities at hand for developer and student communities alike. A program like <strong>‘I unlock Joy’</strong> has that bit of a seductive appeal for individuals to come out and hone their creative skills. A new Marketplace with a unique program like <strong>‘I unlock Joy’</strong> – apt combination.”</p> <br/><p><h4>You may also like to read:</h4></p><ol><li><a
